# B2SAFE-B2STAGE-Training
This training module provides hands-on material for iRODS4, EUDAT B2SAFE, the epicclient (based on handle version 8) and 
[B2STAGE](https://github.com/WillemElbers/B2SAFE-GridFTP).

We provide install files which indocate how the training machines are setup and which will give the users an idea how to 
install the software stack temselves.
The training material itself is targeted at users (scientists) and site admins.
The order of the markdown files proposes the curriculum of the training. Each component takes about 1.5 hours.

If you want to follow a training remotely and need access to preinstalled machines contact #TODO
